      <h1>PROBLEM</h1>

      <p>Currently, there’s not a cloud storage app that does it all. It can become frustrating for users, to switch between apps that do different things. In an already saturated market, the final product needs to combine a few compelling and unique features. Ultimately, as a designer, I need to help define its key differentiators, find the target audience, brand identity and make the important decisions.</p>

    </div>
    <div class="solution">
      <h1>SOLUTION</h1>
      <p>During the research process, my first attempt was to conduct a competitive analysis to learn a tremendous amount about the potential competitors. I created user flows for their products and analyzed them. I was able to identify the priorities and the weak points of the competitors. I also conducted a 20-question user survey to better understand users' preferences. After researching and analyzing, I evaluated the competitive landscape to capitalize on the missed opportunities of competitors and find the opportunities in this already saturated market.</p>

    <p data-aos="fade-left" data-aos-delay="700">I picked three popular platforms for cloud storage services to gain insights on the market and find the opportunities. Cloud Storage is only a small feature to Google, but it is almost 100% to Dropbox. Google can easily use other services to subsidize the loss in Google Drive. It is much harder for Dropbox to do the same. Comparing to Google drive, Dropbox specializes in cloud storage, featuring creative team collaboration. Evernote is quite different from the previous two services. Although it offers some space for file storage, its primary feature is capturing and organizing notes, files, photos, webpages and voice memos in one place. A new service can compete in this field by providing stable upload and download speed, secure data confidentiality, enough free storage space, fast and easy syncing and sharing, and excellent file version control.</p>

    <p style="margin:0 10%;">The target market is users with high technology usage, and those professionals who want to work with their team through an online service. The service is preferably used in business contexts. After exploring some of the competitors’ brands, I found out that their brand designing is quite simple and direct. For example, Dropbox’s logo is an open box. They suggest that they have evolved from a literal box to “a collection of surfaces to show that Dropbox is an open platform, and a place for creation”.  I want to name this service “cloud office”, since it is the service that connects users with any device on their hands and enables the users to work on the cloud. I come up with a few key words that I can cooperate into the branding: cloud, office, connection, computer.</p>

<p style="margin:0 10%; padding-top:3%;">As to the app logo design, users can find concepts of computer, sharing, and cloud. Since the app logo is relatively complicated, I decided to make another version of the actual logo type. The final logo is simple yet elegant. The pursuit of minimalism, gender-neutral design should be reflected in the design. The visual effect will be very calm, steady, harmonious and unified.</p>

  <div style="margin:0 10%;">
  <p>I conducted one remote and one in person user tests. A usability test script was then developed. Overall, the three users had a positive response to the site and were able to navigate the site smoothly. These two testers are both quite familiar with cloud-based services like this. Tests indicated that while the structure and purpose of the website was fairly clear, users were somewhat confused by the underdeveloped wireframes. Through the click tests, the two testers were asked to add content to their dashboard, sign up for an account and organize a piece of content. </p>
  <p>The results of the user testing showed that the initial product was on-track with the basic features I had tried to work on. Testers tend to be confused about prototypes. They did not know how to move on to the next screen. I reminded them that it’s just a prototype and they are helping me to see if the buttons work and identify problem areas.I will use the test result to refine the design.</p>
  <p>Adding a piece of content task: the “new “ button is bigger than other buttons</p>
  <p>Organize the content task:  Testers first think it’s the organize drop menu on the top to organize all the contents. I let them both know that it was to organize a file. They tried to open the notes file and clicked “menu”. They asked if there’s an easier way, so that they don’t have to open the file. I added “ move to” link on hover. I made some changes to the design according to the test results.</p>

  <p style="margin:0 10% 3% 10%;" >This was my very first UX/UI design project. It was really enlightening to take the whole project from the very beginning with research all the way to the end with the whole finished design. It has taught so many things. First and foremost, I should always put my heart into it. I should continuously have a passion for art and design, which is to achieve a design with assiduous research and persistent effort. I need to be creative and have the blueprint I want in my head. After constructing the plan, I need to be flexible enough to use the most rational solution to achieve the most emotional and beautiful blueprint. Another important thing in UI design is the proficiency of using design applications. Throughout the whole project, I practiced using Figma, illustrator, adobe XD every day, and the progress has greatly improved my work efficiency. It has definitely taught me that my design should always be based on the preference of users. Users’ opinions are so valuable. User testing is so important that every major step of my design should come with a usability test. As a designer, I should always understand the needs and habits of the users from their own perspective.
</p>
<p style="margin:0 10% 3% 10%;" >If I had more time and resources, I would have fleshed out the designs more and spent more time developing that. I am proud of my design comparing to where it was in the beginning, however I still see elements that I want to change. Especially after the user tests and the finishing touches. I would also do a research with more potential users, test with more people and code the design into an actual demo site.
