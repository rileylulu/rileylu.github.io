    <p>My name is Ruiyi Lu. I was born in Shanghai, China. I came to the United States back in 2011. I have never really clearly seen my potential in the UI/UX field until the recent years. One year ago, I logged onto a website called Udemy and got fascinated with all the web designing courses on there. I started watching them and practicing with the videos. Every day is filled with satisfaction and happiness.  The joy I got from this has led me to enroll in the UX/UI apprenticeship of Bloc.  I’m passionate about what I’m learning, and I want to progress to a professional level. I have been a language teacher for almost 7 years. To teach a good lesson, I need to have a great lesson plan, design the presentation with visual incentives, and deliver the lesson with confidence. I seek feedbacks from the students, parents and other teachers, and I update the lessons according to their suggestions. In design, a good designer isn’t simply a creative individual--one also needs skills that attribute to the other parts of the design process: planning, perfecting, communicating and executing. These are the exact skills I gained from the experience of teaching. Teaching is a teamwork, so is designing. By effectively communicating with other designers, I will contribute to the team much more that you can imagine. I love what I do right now, and I have the greatest passsion in this field. Connect with me and let's take the adventure together.
