    <div class="introduction">
      <p class="reveal">My name is Ruiyi Lu. I was born in Shanghai, China. I came to the United States back in 2011. I started watching web designing videos and practicing along with the videos. Before I became a UI designer, I have been a language teacher for several years. To teach a good lesson, I need to have a great lesson plan, design the
        presentation with visual incentives, and deliver the lesson with confidence. I seek feedbacks from the students, parents and other teachers, and I update the lessons according to their suggestions. In design, a good designer isn’t simply a
        creative individual--one also needs skills that attribute to the other parts of the design process: planning, perfecting, communicating and executing. These are the exact skills I gained from the experience of teaching. Teaching is a
        teamwork, so is designing. By effectively communicating with other designers, I will contribute to the team much more that you can imagine. </p>
        <p class="reveal">
          Over the past a few years, I have dedeicated myself to a career of UI/UX designing. Now, I have more than 3 years of professional experience as an UI developer and UI/UX designer in design, development and test of web - based and front-end applications. I’ve leaned on to the AGILE development environment and interactive design process – research, iterations, prototypes,executing and testing – that I believe is crucial to solving any problem. As a born problem-solver, I value attention to details in the design process and I approach complex problems with simplicity. I learned what it meant to be a strategic thinker and how refocus the different skills and talents I had previously accrued over the years into a process that produces user centered designing. Good design is a beautiful conversation rooted in a deep understanding of the people you are creating solutions for.
